## Space Invaders 
This project was created as the first project for the course SEIF-SG-12 by General Assembly. I chose to recreate Space Invaders for my first project to pay tribute to the classic game.

### Project Description
The project runs like the classic Space Invaders game with the addition of three difficulty modes.

### How to Run the Project
Open the index.html in a browser.

### Technologies Used
The game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It runs in canvas in HTML linked to separate CSS and JavaScript files.

### Bugs / Fixes
1) alert button sometimes does not go away when 'ok' is pressed
2) Speed can vary depending on browser

### Possible Extensions
1) Customizable appearances for the player and aliens
2) A pause/unpause game function
3) Player can have more than one life except in hard mode
4) Aliens need more than one hit to be destroyed in hard mode
5) Mobile friendly
6) Sound effects
