## Space Invaders 
I created this project as the first of four projects for the course SEIF-SG-12 by General Assembly. I chose to recreate Space Invaders for my first project to pay tribute to the classic game.

### Project Description
The project runs like the classic Space Invaders game with the addition of three difficulty modes.

### How to Run the Project
Open the index.html in a browser.

### Technologies Used
The game is created in a standard HTML boilerplate and runs in a canvas. CSS elements have been added in a linked CSS file to alter the appearance of the starting page (i.e. main menu). The game logic runs separately in a linked JavaScript file.

The JavaScript uses a variety of techniques covered in Unit 1 of the course SEIF-SG-12, including if conditionals, loops, array methods, callbacks, classes, etc. Although a significant portion of the JavaScript is based on a tutorial, I have added comments throughout the file to explain the code and show my understanding of it.

I have also added certain features not covered in the tutorial, such as a scoreboard that updates the player's score in real-time, three different difficulty modes for the game to run, and a main menu page.

### Bugs / Fixes
1) alert button does not go away when 'ok' is pressed
2) Speed settings can vary depending on browser?
3) Hard mode is too hard?

### Possible Extensions
1) Customizable appearances for the player and aliens
2) A pause/unpause function
3) Player can have more than one life except in hard mode?
4) Aliens need more than one hit to be destroyed in hard mode?
5) Mobile friendly?
6) Sound effects?

### Credits
I would like to credit Nicolai B. Andersen for his tutorial on how to recreate Space Invaders with HTML and JavaScript. Link to Andersen's tutorial: https://betterprogramming.pub/create-the-classic-space-invaders-game-af087786d63b 

I would also like to thank my course instructors Yudy and Leonard, teaching assistants Yuyao and Kevin, and my fellow coursemates for their guidance and feedback in the creation of this project.
